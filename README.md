# PopularMovies
An Android app that allows users to find the most popular movies that are on display.

### API Key

The app uses themoviedb.org API to get movie information and posters. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file:

```gradle
MY_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY="abc123"
